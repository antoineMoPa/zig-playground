# My impression so far

+ Zig is pretty simple, which is nice!
+ That comptime stuff looks very powerful.
+ Types make sense so far.
+ The base philosophy is nice.
+ Embedded test framework is a good idea.

- Debbuging tools are lacking.
  - Zig has no out-of-the-box support for sourcemaps in webassembly.

- Zig is not as safe as rust (no borrow checks)
